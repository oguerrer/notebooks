    "#Zero-Intelligence Labor\n",
    "####by Omar A. Guerrero, University of Oxford\n",
    "We will develop the simplest possible labor market. We call it zero-intelligence because workers and agents are like atoms, they have no behavior and their dynamics can be easily described by a stochastic process. That is, an institution in which workers and firms find each other , engage in productive activities, and terminate their relation. In this model, the only source of unemployment is the so called structural unemployment: the one generated by the simple fact that people loose their jobs due to the natural dynamics of the economy (e.g. firms growing, companies going under shrinking, new technologies available, etc.). In order to model this economy, we need workers, firms, an exogenous source of unemployment generation, and a fixed wage (exogenously determined). In this model, employed workers may loose their job with certain probability while the unemployed gain employment at randomly chosen firms. We only keep track of the employment status (employed or unemployed) and wage (zero if unemployed) of every worker. The intention of this exercise is to layout the simplest agent-computing foundations of a labor market."

Each worker knows its own wage and the firm for which she works. In case of unemployment, both the wage and the employer are None. This allows for a worker to be employed while earning a zero wage, for example, an entrepreneur. Finally, we will specify what the worker does in every time step. If she is employed, she might lose her job. On the other hand, if she is unemployed, she will find a firm at random and become employed there."
