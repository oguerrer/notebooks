    "# The Statistics Bureau\n",
     "####by Omar A. Guerrero, University of Oxford\n",
    "So far we have created a simple labor market where the only unemployment is the natural unemployment rate. Since our model has a detailed specification at the level of each agent and firm, it allow us to analyze several temporal and cross-sectional aspects of our artificial economy. In order to facilitate the analysis, we will develop a new class of agent: the statistics bureau. This agent will be in charge of performing surveys and census in our population. The implementation of the statistics bureau is not only a natural way to think about the data collection of our model, but it also a cleaner way to perform data collection for policy experiments in the future."

    "Plot the evolution of the unemployment rate. Note that this model has a simple mathematical representation. That is, the number of unemployed people $U_t$ in period $t$ is the result of the previous employed who lost their jobs: $U_t=\\lambda (L_{t-1} - U_{t-1})$. In the steady state, the average level of unemployment does not change with time, so $U=\\lambda (L - U)$. We can normalize this expression by dividing by th labor force $L$ and denoting the normalized variables by lower case: $u=\\lambda (1 - u)$. Finally, we can solve for the unemployment rate $u$ and obtain the analytical prediction: $u=\\frac{\\lambda}{1+\\lambda}$. We test this prediction against the model output graphically in this plot."
